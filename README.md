Hello there! This is another web development project of mine.

This is a small survey form that stores different types of input: text, email, numbers and checkboxes.
The whole content can only be understood by a big Office fan. So I hope that if you are one, you will have fun with it!

The page is made with HTML and CSS. It is fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen.

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
